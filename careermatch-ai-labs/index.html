<li>Hurray! we have successfully created a prompt using Google Gemini 2.0 to analyze resumes and job details, providing a score and suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li>We will now explore different ways to enhance the performance of the model by fine-tuning the prompt. Click on the saved prompt to edit it. <img alt="edit-prompt" src="img/ddab47681be5147e.png"></li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Fine-tuning the prompt" duration="0">
        <p>Next, we will fine-tune the prompt to improve the results. There are 3 advanced prompt settings you can configure to enhance the performance of the model. These settings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: This setting controls the randomness of the model&#39;s output. A higher temperature value (e.g., 0.8) will make the output more creative and diverse, while a lower value (e.g., 0.2) will make it more focused and deterministic.</li>
<li><strong>Output Token Limit</strong>: This setting controls the maximum number of tokens (words) the model can generate in its response. A higher limit allows for longer responses, while a lower limit restricts the output length.</li>
<li><strong>Top P</strong>: This setting controls the diversity of the model&#39;s output by sampling from the top P percentage of the probability distribution. A higher value (e.g., 0.9) allows for more diverse outputs, while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) makes the output more focused on the most likely words.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="advanced-prompting" src="img/561174431e3c6c5c.png"></p>
<p>Ensure safety filters are enabled to avoid any harmful content in the response. These settings are disabled by default. <img alt="safety-filters" src="img/97ac2d6768a4f5d7.png"></p>
<p>You can also refine the prompt text to improve its effectiveness. Adjust it to be more flexible or specific based on your goals.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Run the generate code" duration="0">
        <p>When we add a prompt to Vertex AI, it automatically generates a code snippet that can be used to call the model programmatically. This code can be run in a Python environment, such as Cloud Shell environment, Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the <code>Get Code</code> button to get the code snippet. We&#39;ll close this section for now and return to it later to retrieve the code snippet for calling the model. <img alt="get-code" src="img/7ba87995c41de81d.png"><img alt="code" src="img/821c475728525411.png"></li>
<li>Click <code>Activate Cloud Shell</code> toward the top right corner of the cloud console to open the Cloud Shell environment and editor so we can run the code snippet. You may need to also authorize Cloud Shell to access your Google Cloud resources. <img alt="activate-cloud-shell" src="img/d57dd1d07c6e1979.png"><img alt="authorize-cloud-shell" src="img/fea509057f1b5aa6.png"></li>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Deploying the application to Google Cloud Run" duration="0">
        <ol type="1">
<li>Lets analyze the code for CareerMatch AI and deploy it to Google Cloud Run. The application is built using Streamlit, a popular framework for building web applications in Python <img alt="careermatch-ai-code" src="img/148938ba9a128eb9.png"></li>
<li>Once the user provides the resume file/text and job details, the application uses the <code>google-genai</code> library to call the Gemini model and get the analysis and matching score. The results are then displayed on the web page.</li>
<li>To deploy the application on Google Cloud Run, navigate to the following <a href="https://github.com/boltdynamics/careermatch-ai" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> and click on the <code>Run on Google Cloud</code> button found in Readme, <img alt="run-on-google-cloud" src="img/bb330096ff5006b.png"></li>
<li>This will redirect you to the Google Cloud Console, where you are required to trust the repository and authorize cloud shell <img alt="trust-repo" src="img/37987e854058af9c.png"><img alt="authorize-cloud-shell" src="img/fea509057f1b5aa6.png"></li>
<li>A cloud shell machine will be provisioned for you, and the code will be cloned into the cloud shell environment. Select the project you created earlier and click on <code>Continue</code> to proceed. <img alt="select-project" src="img/8917fbf7196392af.png"></li>
<li>The process will enable Cloud Run APIs on the project. Select <code>us-central1</code> for the region. <img alt="select-region" src="img/7bc7619ae9ffbf1.png"></li>
<li>The process will build a Docker image for the application, upload it to Artifact Registry and deploy it to Google Cloud Run service. This may take a few minutes. <img alt="deploy-to-cloud-run" src="img/8732f3bf3dd3eaf2.png"></li>
<li>Congratulations! The application has been successfully deployed to Google Cloud Run. You can access the application using the URL provided in the terminal <img alt="application-deployed" src="img/64b833ad052dbdac.png"></li>
<li>Lets try out the application by uploading a resume and job details. Download this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ZxyQ4WVJzMsXTL2kL4s6Lb9-4ESfEYTldxOUQZtzdo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">sample resume</a> in PDF format. <img alt="download-resume" src="img/60afc46e0b4d0d93.png"></li>
<li>Click on <code>Browse Files</code> to upload the resume file. The resume highlights experience in Wordpress Development and Backend Engineering.

It also suggests some improvements to the resume, such as adding more details about their past experience and skills related to the job posting. <img alt="analyze-resume-result" src="img/545b1c5715dd56aa.png"></li>
<li>Now lets try out a different job posting that is very different from the resume. Paste this job post <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/82809251?ref=search-standalone&type=promoted&origin=jobTitle#sol=2b9aceb19b46620aeafdc3f45f8aa72596440966" target="_blank">link</a> in the <code>Enter job posting URL</code> section and click on <code>Analyze</code> to get the analysis and matching score.</li>
<li>We can see that the resume does not match the job posting for a Drone Operator. Software engineering and drone operation are two very different fields and as a result, the application provides a 25% match score, indicating that the resume does not align well with the job requirements. <img alt="analyze-resume-result-2" src="img/c869752c268bee6a.png"></li>
<li>You can also leave the job posting URL section empty and click on <code>Analyze</code> to get the analysis on a broad level. Gemini uses grounding feature to leverage Google search and suggest best ways to find relevant job postings. The application provides a list of job boards and websites where the user can find job postings related to their skills and experience. <img alt="analyze-resume-result-3" src="img/9648c94c1d0151e4.png"><img alt="analyze-resume-result-4" src="img/481aa2414e0b3459.png"><img alt="analyze-resume-result-5" src="img/d45a4bec8d3f46a0.png"></li>
<li>You can also try out different job postings and resumes to see how well the application performs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a job seeker assistant application using Google Gemini and Streamlit on Google Cloud Run. The application can analyze resumes, match candidates with job postings, and recommend the best career opportunities.</p>
