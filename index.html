        <p>Welcome to the Google Build With AI event series!</p>
<p>In this hands-on workshop, we will explore how to leverage Google Gemini to create a powerful job seeker assistant. This session is designed for developers, data scientists, and anyone eager to harness AI to streamline workflows, unlock new possibilities, and drive innovation in their projects and everyday life.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Gemini LLM</h2>
<p>Gemini is a suite of advanced artificial intelligence models created by Google DeepMind. What sets it apart is its ability to understand and work with various forms of information, not just text. This means it can handle and combine things like images, sounds, videos, and code, in addition to written language. - <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Vertex AI</h2>
<p>Vertex AI is Google Cloud&#39;s comprehensive platform designed to help developers and businesses build and deploy AI applications, especially those powered by generative AI. Access and utilize AI Studio, Agent Builder, and 160+ foundation models including Gemini 2.0 from Vertex AI. - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>A sneak peak into what you will be deploying to Google Cloud today</h2>
<p>The application deployed to Google Cloud Run uses Gradio for the front end interface which handles the interaction with Vertex AI. Features include resume analysis, similarity scoring, and personalized job recommendations. <img alt="gradio" src="img/2e1e591e5fe3e0b0.png"></p>
<p>If time permits, we will also deploy a custom version of the CareerMatch AI application using Streamlit, a popular framework for building web applications in Python. <img alt="careermatch-ai-app" src="img/94147468134236cf.png"></p>

        <ol type="1">
<li>Ensure you have selected the <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001</code> model. Then, paste the following prompt in the <code>Systems Instructions</code> box:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-markdown" class="language-markdown">You are a job seeker assistant. Your task is to analyze the resume and job details provided and give a score from 0 to 10 on how well the resume matches the job.
The score should be based on the following criteria:
1. Key skills that match.
2. Missing skills or qualifications.
3. Suggestions for improving the resume or get better qualifications to better match the job.
The score should be a number between 0 and 10, where 0 means little to no match and 10 means a perfect match.

Any questions irrelevant to matching the resume and job details should be replied to with - Sorry, I cannot help you with that, I am a job seeker assistant and I can only help you with matching resumes and job details.

<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>On the right hand side panel, click on <code>Advanced</code> which will reveal 3 advanced prompt settings you can configure to enhance the performance of the model:<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: This setting controls the randomness of the model&#39;s output. A higher temperature value (e.g., 0.8) will make the output more creative and diverse, while a lower value (e.g., 0.2) will make it more focused and deterministic. <code>Set the value to 0 for a more deterministic output.</code></li>
<li><strong>Output Token Limit</strong>: This setting controls the maximum number of tokens (words) the model can generate in its response. <code>Set this value to 4096 to allow for longer responses.</code></li>
<li><strong>Top P</strong>: This setting controls the diversity of the model&#39;s output by sampling from the top P percentage of the probability distribution. A higher value (e.g., 0.9) allows for more diverse outputs, while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) makes the output more focused on the most likely words. <code>Set this value to 0 for a more focused output.</code><img alt="system-instructions" src="img/5a5b0413272da45d.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Safety Filters</strong>: Gemini 2.0 has safety filters to prevent the generation of harmful content. You can enable or disable these filters based on your requirements. By default, these filters are disabled. <img alt="safety-filters" src="img/ca027f1c0348eb32.png"></li>
<li>Its time to provide Gemini with a prompt. Enter the job details and sample resume in the prompt section,</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="[OPTIONAL] Deploy a python Job Seeker Assistant App on Cloud Run with Google Gemini &amp; Streamlit – From Scratch!" duration="0">
        <p>In this section, we will deploy our own version of CareerMatch AI application to Google Cloud Run. The application is built using Streamlit, a popular framework for building web applications in Python. Streamlit is similar to Gradio, and they both provide a simple way to create web applications. <img alt="careermatch-ai" src="img/4b5a384d9cacd561.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lets analyze the code for CareerMatch AI and deploy it to Google Cloud Run. The application is built using Streamlit, a popular framework for building web applications in Python <img alt="careermatch-ai-code" src="img/148938ba9a128eb9.png"></li>
<li>Once the user provides the resume file/text and job details, the application uses the <code>google-genai</code> library to call the Gemini model and get the analysis and matching score. The results are then displayed on the web page.</li>
<li>The analysis prompt is shown below, <img alt="analysis-prompt" src="img/45423840e0020079.png"></li>
<li>If no job details are provided, the application uses the grounding feature of Gemini to suggest the best ways to find relevant job postings. The application provides a list of job boards and websites where the user can find job postings related to their skills and experience. <img alt="web-search-prompt" src="img/17536181bbc07ff4.png"></li>
<li>To deploy the application on Google Cloud Run, navigate to the following <a href="https://github.com/boltdynamics/careermatch-ai" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> and click on the <code>Run on Google Cloud</code> button found in Readme, <img alt="run-on-google-cloud" src="img/bb330096ff5006b.png"></li>
<li>This will redirect you to the Google Cloud Console, where you are required to trust the repository and authorize cloud shell <img alt="trust-repo" src="img/37987e854058af9c.png"><img alt="authorize-cloud-shell" src="img/fea509057f1b5aa6.png"></li>
<li>A cloud shell machine will be provisioned for you, and the code will be cloned into the cloud shell environment. Select the project you created earlier and click on <code>Continue</code> to proceed. <img alt="select-project" src="img/8917fbf7196392af.png"></li>
<li>If you get a <code>Quota exhausted</code> error, please retry the deployment process by running the following command in the cloud shell terminal,</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">rm -rf careermatch-ai &amp;&amp; cloudshell_open --repo_url &#34;https://github.com/boltdynamics/careermatch-ai.git&#34; --git_branch &#34;main&#34; --page &#34;shell&#34; --force_new_clone
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="quota-exhausted" src="img/1e43d23d67a4c366.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="9">
<li>The process will enable Cloud Run APIs on the project. Select <code>us-central1</code> for the region. <img alt="select-region" src="img/7bc7619ae9ffbf1.png"></li>
<li>The process will build a Docker image for the application, upload it to Artifact Registry and deploy it to Google Cloud Run service. This may take a few minutes. <img alt="deploy-to-cloud-run" src="img/2f7bec1b56af70f7.png"></li>
<li>Congratulations! The application has been successfully deployed to Google Cloud Run. You can access the application using the URL provided in the terminal <img alt="application-deployed" src="img/64b833ad052dbdac.png"></li>
<li>Lets try out the application by uploading a resume and job details. Download this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ZxyQ4WVJzMsXTL2kL4s6Lb9-4ESfEYTldxOUQZtzdo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">sample resume</a> in PDF format. <img alt="download-resume" src="img/60afc46e0b4d0d93.png"></li>
<li>Click on <code>Browse Files</code> to upload the resume file. The resume highlights experience in Wordpress Development and Backend Engineering. Paste this job post <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/83736354?ref=search-standalone&type=standard&origin=jobTitle#sol=cca3022d42ab285717bfb8ad10df98e853094919" target="_blank">link</a> in the <code>Enter job posting URL</code> section and click on <code>Analyze</code> to get the analysis and matching score. <img alt="analyze-resume" src="img/86a594cd0f890c2b.png"></li>
<li>We can see that the resume matches the job posting for Wordpress Specialist at Cadence Connect. The application provides a 75% match score, indicating that the resume aligns well with the job requirements. It also suggests some improvements to the resume, such as adding more details about their past experience and skills related to the job posting. <img alt="analyze-resume-result" src="img/545b1c5715dd56aa.png"></li>
<li>If the match is above 50%, the application will automatically generate a cover letter for the job posting. You can download the cover letter by clicking on the <code>Download Cover Letter</code> button. <img alt="cover-letter" src="img/35040ad1578ca4b6.png"></li>
<li>Now lets try out a different job posting that is very different from the resume. Paste this job post <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/83935106?type=promoted&ref=search-standalone&origin=cardTitle#sol=f7c09fd162dcf3880d9cb375e7b4bd42b896e1bb" target="_blank">link</a> in the <code>Enter job posting URL</code> section and click on <code>Analyze</code> to get the analysis and matching score.</li>
<li>We can see that the resume does not match the job posting for a Electronic Warfare Operator. Software engineering and Military Warfare are two very different careers and as a result, the application provides a 5% match score, indicating that the resume does not align well with the job requirements. <img alt="analyze-resume-result-2" src="img/4d15d1b9a71d2c42.png"></li>
<li>You can also leave the job posting URL section empty and click on <code>Analyze</code> to get the analysis on a broad level. Gemini uses grounding feature to leverage Google search and suggest best ways to find relevant job postings. The application provides a list of job boards and websites where the user can find job postings related to their skills and experience. <img alt="analyze-resume-result-3" src="img/9648c94c1d0151e4.png"><img alt="analyze-resume-result-4" src="img/481aa2414e0b3459.png"><img alt="analyze-resume-result-5" src="img/d45a4bec8d3f46a0.png"></li>
<li>You can also try out different job postings and resumes to see how well the application performs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a job seeker assistant application using Google Gemini and Streamlit on Google Cloud Run. The application can analyze resumes, match candidates with job postings, and recommend the best career opportunities.</p>
